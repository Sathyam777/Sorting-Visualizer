# Sorting Visualizer 🧮

## Overview

**Sorting Visualizer** is an educational web application designed to help users visually understand how different sorting algorithms work. The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display sorting algorithms step-by-step, giving users a graphical representation of how data is sorted by popular algorithms.

This tool is perfect for students, developers, and anyone interested in learning or revisiting sorting concepts in an interactive way.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎨 **Visual Representation**: Graphical animations that clearly show the steps of sorting algorithms.
  - **Colored Representation of Steps**:
    1. 🔵 **Blue**: Default color (unsorted elements).
    2. 🟡 **Yellow**: Elements being compared.
    3. 🔴 **Red**: Elements identified as in the incorrect position and to be moved.
    4. 🟢 **Green**: Elements in their correct position.
- 🎛 **Adjustable Settings**: Modify the speed of the sorting process and change the size of the array being sorted.
- 🎲 **Random Array Generation**: Generate arrays of different sizes and values with a single click.
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: The application adapts to different screen sizes, so it’s viewable on both desktop and mobile devices.

5. **Quick Sort** 🔴  
   - Time Complexity: O(n log n) (average case)  
   - Space Complexity: O(log n)  
   - Stable: No  

6. **Heap Sort** 🟣  
   - Time Complexity: O(n log n)  
   - Space Complexity: O(1)  
   - Stable: No

## 💻 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   https://github.com/Sathyam777/Sorting-Visualizer

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Sorting-Visualizer

3. Open index.html in your web browser to view the application:

   On Windows, double-click index.html to open in your default browser. On Mac or Linux, you can run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   open index.html

## 🛠 Tools Used
- HTML5: Provides the structure for the webpage.
- CSS3: Styles the application and creates smooth animations.
- JavaScript: Handles the logic behind the sorting algorithms and animates them.
- Sorting Concepts: Implemented sorting algorithms based on Data Structures and Algorithms       principles.

## 📊 How It Works
The Sorting Visualizer provides an animated representation of how sorting algorithms rearrange an array of bars (each representing a number). The bars change color and position to visually demonstrate the key operations of each algorithm, such as comparisons and swaps.

- Colors: Highlight comparisons and swaps between array elements.
- Animations: Slow down the sorting process to help users follow each step.
- Customizations: Users can adjust the speed of the algorithm and the size of the array for a better learning experience.
